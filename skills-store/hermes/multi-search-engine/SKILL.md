## Best Practices for Large-Scale Searching

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
```bash
# Phase 1: Broad understanding
multi-search "blockchain technology" --engines wolfram,google --summarize

# Phase 2: Specific aspects
multi-search "blockchain consensus algorithms" --engines github,arxiv --time "past year"

# Phase 3: Latest developments
multi-search "blockchain 2026 trends" --engines twitter,reddit --time "past month"
```

### 2. Use Engine Specializations
- **WolframAlpha**: Facts, computations, definitions
- **Google**: Comprehensive web coverage
- **Baidu**: Chinese-language content
- **GitHub**: Code and technical discussions
- **arXiv**: Academic papers
- **Twitter**: Real-time updates and opinions
- **Reddit**: Community discussions and experiences

### 3. Manage Information Overload
```bash
# Limit results initially
multi-search "large topic" --count 5 --summarize

# Use filters to reduce noise
multi-search "topic" --filter "-marketing -sales -advertisement"

# Focus on authoritative sources
multi-search "topic" --sites "*.edu,*.gov,*.org"
```

### 4. Cross-Verify Important Information
```bash
# Check multiple sources
multi-search "important fact" --engines google,duckduckgo,bing --compare

# Look for consensus
multi-search "controversial topic" --analyze sentiment --check consensus

# Trace to primary sources
multi-search "news story" --trace-sources --find-original
```

## Performance Optimization

### For Large Searches
```bash
# Use parallel processing
multi-search "extensive research" --parallel --workers 5

# Cache frequent queries
multi-search "common query" --cache --ttl 3600

# Batch similar searches
multi-search-batch queries.txt --output-dir results/
```

### For Unknown Domains
```bash
# Start with exploratory search
multi-search "new domain" --exploratory --map-concepts

# Build knowledge graph
multi-search "topic" --build-graph --show-connections

# Identify key subtopics
multi-search "broad field" --identify-subtopics --limit 10
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Too many results**
   ```bash
   multi-search "query" --filter --limit 10 --summarize
   ```

2. **Irrelevant results**
   ```bash
   multi-search "query" --exclude "irrelevant terms" --engine-specific
   ```

3. **Regional restrictions**
   ```bash
   multi-search "query" --engines duckduckgo,startpage,qwant --privacy
   ```

4. **Language barriers**
   ```bash
   multi-search "query" --translate --languages en,zh --compare
   ```

5. **Outdated information**
   ```bash
   multi-search "query" --time "past week" --sort date
   ```

## Development & Extension

### Adding New Search Engines
1. Create engine adapter in `engines/` directory
2. Implement required interface:
   - `search(query, params)`
   - `parse_results(html)`
   - `get_config()`
3. Add to engine registry
4. Test with various query types

### Custom Search Pipelines
```python
# Example custom pipeline
pipeline = SearchPipeline()
pipeline.add_stage("wolfram", "foundational")
pipeline.add_stage("google", "comprehensive")  
pipeline.add_stage("github", "technical")
pipeline.add_stage("arxiv", "academic")
results = pipeline.execute("query")
```
