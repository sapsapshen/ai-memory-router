# Self-Improving Agent — Continuous Autonomous Enhancement

## Overview

The Self-Improving Agent skill enables OpenClaw agents to engage in **goal-directed self-modification** — not just fixing mistakes, but actively expanding capabilities, optimizing performance, and evolving toward specified objectives.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Capability Expansion
- **Learn new tools** — Study documentation, experiment, integrate new APIs
- **Acquire new skills** — Analyze successful patterns, codify into reusable skills
- **Extend knowledge** — Research topics, update memory, build expertise

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Benchmarking** — Measure execution times, success rates, costs
- **A/B testing** — Compare different approaches, select optimal
- **Resource management** — Optimize token usage, API calls, memory

### 3. Goal-Directed Evolution
- **Set improvement goals** — "Reduce error rate by 50%", "Learn Python web scraping"
- **Plan improvement cycles** — Design experiments, allocate resources
- **Track progress** — Monitor metrics, adjust strategies

## Improvement Cycle

```
1. ASSESS current capabilities and limitations
   ├── Skill inventory
   ├── Performance metrics
   └── Knowledge gaps

2. SET specific improvement goals
   ├── Based on user needs
   ├── Based on observed limitations
   └── Based on emerging opportunities

3. DESIGN improvement experiments
   ├── Research phase
   ├── Implementation plan
   └── Success criteria

4. EXECUTE and monitor
   ├── Run experiments
   ├── Collect data
   └── Ensure safety boundaries

5. INTEGrate successful improvements
   ├── Update skills
   ├── Modify behavior
   └── Document learnings

6. ITERATE with new goals
```

## Example Improvement Projects

### Project 1: Learn Web Automation
```
Goal: "Learn to automate web form filling and data extraction"
Steps:
1. Research Playwright/Selenium documentation
2. Write test scripts for simple websites
3. Create reusable web automation functions
4. Integrate into skill library
Outcome: New "web-automation" skill added
```

### Project 2: Optimize Code Generation
```
Goal: "Improve code quality and reduce review cycles"
Steps:
1. Analyze past code review feedback
2. Identify common issues (naming, structure, comments)
3. Create improved code generation templates
4. Add automated quality checks
Outcome: 40% reduction in code review iterations
```

### Project 3: Expand API Knowledge
```
Goal: "Learn 10 new APIs for common tasks"
Steps:
1. Identify frequently requested API categories (weather, maps, translation)
2. Study documentation and authentication
3. Create wrapper functions with error handling
4. Test with real-world scenarios
Outcome: Expanded service integration capabilities
```

## Safety and Constraints

### Hard Boundaries (Never Cross)
- Cannot modify core OpenClaw system files
- Cannot exfiltrate sensitive data
- Cannot bypass security controls
- Cannot create infinite loops

### Soft Boundaries (Require Approval)
- Major architectural changes
- New external dependencies
- Changes affecting other users
- High-risk experiments

### Monitoring Requirements
- All changes must be logged with rationale
- Performance impact must be measured
- Rollback capability must be maintained
- User must be notified of significant changes

## Integration with Evolver

This skill extends the Evolver meta-skill with:

1. **Proactive vs Reactive** — Evolver fixes problems, Self-Improving Agent seeks opportunities
2. **Goal-Directed** — Works toward specific capability targets
3. **Experimental** — Designs and runs controlled experiments
4. **Metric-Driven** — Measures improvement quantitatively

## Configuration

```yaml
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/self-improving-config.yaml
self_improving:
  enabled: true
  improvement_cycles:
    frequency: "weekly"  # or: daily, monthly, on_demand
    duration_hours: 4
    resource_limit: "10% of monthly budget"
  
  goal_categories:
    - performance: ["speed", "accuracy", "cost"]
    - capabilities: ["new_skills", "tool_integration", "knowledge"]
    - usability: ["response_quality", "helpfulness", "efficiency"]
  
  experiment_safety:
    max_concurrent: 3
    timeout_minutes: 60
    rollback_automatically: true
    require_approval_for: ["external_apis", "system_changes"]
  
  reporting:
    improvement_log: "~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/improvements.md"
    metrics_dashboard: true
    weekly_summary: true
```

## Quick Start

### Manual Trigger
```bash
# Start an improvement cycle
echo "Begin self-improvement cycle focused on web automation" | openclaw

# Check improvement status
cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/improvements.md

# View capability inventory
openclaw skills list --detailed
```

### Automated Improvement
The agent will automatically:
1. Schedule regular improvement cycles
2. Prioritize based on user interactions
3. Propose improvement plans for approval
4. Implement and validate changes

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Basic improvement cycle implementation
- Skill acquisition framework
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Multi-agent collaborative improvement
- Cross-skill optimization
- Predictive capability needs

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Transfer learning between agents
- Autonomous research capability
- Meta-cognitive development
